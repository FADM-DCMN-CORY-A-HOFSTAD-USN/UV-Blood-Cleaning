**VirusTC's UV-C Autologous Blood Treatment: A New Strategy for Blood Sepsis (Septicemia) at Pacific Health**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In our Hematology Oncology department, the most immediate danger to many of our patients isn't the cancer itself, but life-threatening complications. Sepsis, often triggered by severe treatment-induced neutropenia, is one of the most critical and frequent culprits. To provide a new, rapid line of defense against this threat, Pacific Health is introducing the VirusTC UV-C Autologous Blood Treatment.

This article outlines the process, mechanism, and benefits of this advanced new therapy.

### **The Autologous UV-C Treatment Process**

When a patient is identified for treatment, the process begins much like a standard apheresis procedure. IV access is established, and the patient's blood is drawn into the specialized apheresis machine. From there, the blood undergoes a multi-stage cleaning process:

1.  **Initial Treatment:** The patient's whole blood is drawn, immediately passes through a UV-C light array, and is then filtered by a GVS SQ40 Blood Transfusion Filter.

2.  **Separation:** While under continuous UV-C exposure, the blood is separated into its core components: red blood cells and plasma.

3.  **Targeted Filtration:** Both components are then filtered *again*---each one passing through its own leukocyte reduction filter and an additional GVS SQ40 Blood Transfusion Filter.

4.  **Reinfusion:** Finally, the treated, purified plasma and red blood cells are recombined and safely returned to the patient.

#### **Workflow Summary**

| **Step** | **Action** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Draw & Initial Treat** | Patient's whole blood is drawn and *immediately* passes through a UV-C light array and a GVS SQ40 Blood Transfusion Filter. |
| **2** | **Separate** | While still under continuous UV-C exposure, the blood is separated into its core components: plasma and red blood cells. |
| **3** | **Purify Components** | The separated plasma and red blood cells *each* pass through their own set of filters (a leukocyte reduction filter and another GVS SQ40 filter). |
| **4** | **Recombine & Return** | The purified, treated plasma and red blood cells are recombined and safely returned to the patient. |

### **The Dual-Action Inactivation Mechanism**

This treatment protocol is designed to inactivate pathogens using a powerful, dual-action approach:

1.  **Direct Genetic Inactivation (Photochemistry):** The UV-C light is the primary sterilization tool. As pathogens and residual leukocytes pass through the light array, their DNA and RNA absorb the UV-C photons. This energy causes a photochemical reaction, forming **pyrimidine dimers**---essentially creating permanent, fatal breaks in their genetic code. This damage makes it impossible for them to replicate or cause infection.

2.  **Oxidative Inactivation (Ozone):** Simultaneously, the UV-C light generates medical-grade **ozone ($O_3$)** within the machine. This ozone is a potent virucidal agent that physically destroys pathogens. It works by oxidizing and breaking down their protective outer layers---such as the lipid envelope of a virus or the cell wall of bacteria---rendering them inactive.

#### **Mechanism Summary**

| **Mechanism** | **Direct Genetic Inactivation (Photochemistry)** | **Oxidative Inactivation (Ozone)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent** | UV-C Light Photons ðŸ’¡ | Medical-Grade Ozone ($O_3$) ðŸ’¨ |
| **Target** | DNA & RNA (the genetic code) | Viral Envelope & Capsid (the outer shell) |
| **Action** | Forms **pyrimidine dimers**, breaking the code and preventing replication. | **Oxidizes** and physically destroys the pathogen's protective layers. |
| **Result** | Pathogen is genetically "dead" and cannot reproduce. | Pathogen is physically destroyed and rendered inactive. |

### **Key Patient Benefits: Speed and Safety**

The primary advantage of the VirusTC UV-C treatment is the immediate, critical intervention it provides. Conventional sepsis treatment often involves a hospital stay of weeks or even months, with a long recovery period. Our autologous process is designed to achieve its therapeutic goal in a matter of **hours**.

This rapid treatment is accomplished using the patient's **own blood**, which provides two major benefits:

1.  **Immediate Availability:** There is no delay waiting for compatible donor blood.

2.  **Enhanced Safety:** It completely eliminates the risks associated with transfusions, such as immune reactions, compatibility issues, and the transmission of unknown pathogens.

#### **Benefits: At-a-Glance Comparison**

| **Metric** | **VirusTC UV-C Autologous Treatment** | **Conventional Sepsis Treatment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Treatment Time** | Designed to achieve therapeutic goal in **hours**. | Recovery often takes **weeks to months**. |
| **Blood Source** | **Autologous** (patient's *own* blood). | Relies on **Donor Blood** (allogeneic). |
| **Availability** | **Immediate**---no waiting for a match. | Dependent on blood bank supply and cross-matching. |
| **Key Risks** | **Minimizes risk** by avoiding transfusion. | Risk of immune reactions, compatibility issues, and supply delays. |

### **Specialized Filtration for Patient Safety**

A critical component of our protocol is managing the *result* of this highly effective treatment.

-   **The Challenge:** Our dual-action UV-C process is so effective at inactivating pathogens that it creates a significant volume of inert cellular debris.

-   **The Solution:** To ensure this debris is completely removed before the blood is returned to the patient, our protocol uses high-performance **GVS filters**. These filters are specifically chosen for their high-quality construction and enhanced mechanical strength, allowing them to handle the heavy debris load and ensure the final autologous blood product is purified to the highest standard.
